##  Original Addon Description

> This addon is currently beta quality. There may still be major bugs and rough edges, but in general it should basically work.  
> Due to limitations in Blender's Python APIs, there are also some rough edges that are unfortunately impossible to fix at the moment.

##  HOW TO USE

The moderate expectation is that you have recreated your scene in some way for the Compify process to work with.
- Shoot your footage
- Track your footage
- Recreate the geometry of your footage (be sure to recalculate normals in mesh tools if needed)
  
This is a shot I took and recreated by tracking and then extruding with the wonderful default cube (lol).
